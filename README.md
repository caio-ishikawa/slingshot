Slingshot is a lightweight tool to browse files in the terminal. It allows the user to quickly filter through files in any directory, open them with a text editor (nvim by default), and create/edit/delete files in a simple interface.

Design Goals
------------
- A quick way to navigate, create and edit files in the terminal.
- Easily maintanable.
- Minimal use of third party crates.
